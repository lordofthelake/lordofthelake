# 👨🏼‍💻 Hi, I'm Michele <sub><sub><sup><sub>[miˈkɛːle] ("Mee-KE-le")</sub></sup></sub></sub>

Originally from 🇮🇹 Italy, currently located in 🇩🇪 Berlin, Germany, I've been writing software for the past 15 years. In my career, I've covered a variety of roles, both as individual contributor and as manager, across different companies, founding one in the process.

I work with a wide range of technologies across the entire web stack; I'm equally comfortable managing and provisioning infrastructure, architecting and building an application backend, or creating design systems and implementing UIs.

I have long-stading expertise on:

- Full-stack web development on Ruby on Rails, Node.js, React.js
- Native mobile development on Android (Java) or cross-platform (React Native)
- REST or GraphQL-based API design
- DevOps and infrastructure automation on AWS and Google Cloud, incl. Docker, Kubernetes, and serverless functions

I work as freelance engineer and tech consultant for several companies in Berlin. I work mostly with high-growth companies, either in the early stages — designing the initial software architecture, establishing processes, helping with technical hiring — or in more mature organizations that are looking for help bootstrapping new teams and products.

If you have a project on which you think we should work together, you can contact me via [email](mailto:michele@piccirillo.io) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/michelepiccirillo/).
